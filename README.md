# A Chess Engine by Jai Nagaraj

## Purpose
Back in late 2022, I wanted to challenge my programming skills by building a chess game, complete with rules, graphics, and fun! In fall of 2023, however, I conducted an independent study in the field of game theory, and decided to apply my knowledge to this project. It now serves not only as a functional chess board, but also a homemade chess engine which aspires to become the next Stockfish... although I'd call it a success if it can beat its creator.

## Details
Uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer graphics library in C++. Piece and board graphics taken from Wikimedia Commons. The font used for displaying end status, American Captain, is from FontSpace. All code was created by and belongs to Jai Nagaraj.

## Progress (section created in Jan 2024, so past work is undocumented aside from commits)
1/18/2024 — Version 1 complete, passing starting position Perft tests up to depth 6. Performance time and storage usage leaves much to be desired. <br>
1/12/2024 — Embarking on effort to clean up code and increase encapsulation before Perft. <br>
1/10/2024 — Chess game version 1 complete. Implemented pawn promotion and insufficient material draw, though it is untested. <br>
1/7/2024 — Chess game nearly complete. Need to implement pawn promotion and insufficient material draw to complete. <br>
